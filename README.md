# Automated Floodgate and Monitoring System (AFMS)

## 📌 Project Description
The Automated Floodgate and Monitoring System (AFMS) is an IoT-based application designed to monitor real-time water levels and allow homeowners to control a smart floodgate system. 

The system integrates Flutter (mobile/web app), IoT sensors, and cloud computing to provide real-time data monitoring, alerts, and recommended actions during rising water levels.

This prototype is demonstrated using a micro-scale diorama setup (riverbed and neighborhood model with automated gate).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Flutter (Mobile & Web Application)
- Dart
- IoT Sensors (Water Level Sensor, Microcontroller)
- Cloud Computing (e.g., Firebase / MQTT / Cloud Database)
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📱 Planned Features
- User Authentication (Homeowner / Barangay Role)
- Real-time Water Level Dashboard
- Floodgate Control Module (Open / Close)
- Alert Notification System
- Data Analytics Dashboard (Basic Trends & History)
- Barangay Announcement Module
